This repository contains two example codes for communication using the ESP32 platform. One code demonstrates the transmitting of data from an ESP32 device, while the other demonstrates the receiving of data on another ESP32 device. These examples can be used as a basis for wireless communication applications such as remote control systems, IoT devices, or sensor networks.

ESP_NOW_TRANSMITTERV2.ino: The code for the ESP32 that sends data (transmitter).
ESP_NOW_RECEIVERV2.ino: The code for the ESP32 that receives data (receiver).
Requirements
Hardware: Two ESP32 development boards.
Software: Arduino IDE (with ESP32 board support installed).
Overview
The two examples use the ESP32 Wi-Fi capabilities to establish communication between two devices. The transmitter sends data over Wi-Fi, and the receiver listens for and processes the incoming data.

Transmit Code (transmit.ino)
This code demonstrates how the ESP32 can send data using its Wi-Fi capabilities. It connects to a Wi-Fi network and transmits a simple message over UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to a specified IP address (the receiver's IP address).

Key Features:
Establishes a Wi-Fi connection.
Sends a string message to a predefined IP address and port.
Loops and transmits the message at regular intervals.
